# Compiling

    This library was created using mingw32 on windows.
    Cross compiling should not be a problem.

    Make sure that your compiler supports c++11, and that you have installed curl.
    When running the test application, you will need to copy libcurl.dll into the application folder.
    
    Use "make" to compile an example application
    Use "make lib" to compile a static library
